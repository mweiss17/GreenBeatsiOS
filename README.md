Submitted this application for COMP307 -- a Web Development at McGill. 
Had several conversations with Naziha Mestaou to prototype and flesh out her idea, and built this application using her art.
Inspired by Naziha Mestaoui's monumental and participatory work of art designed for the UN Climate Conference, COP21 in Paris
